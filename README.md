# A Formal Verification of Origami Geometry and Constructible Numbers

A Coq formalization establishing the mathematical foundations of paper folding as a construction system. The development defines the seven Huzita-Hatori axioms governing single-fold origami operations and
characterizes the resulting field of constructible numbers—those obtainable from rational starting points through arithmetic, square roots, and real roots of cubic polynomials with constructible
coefficients. The formalization proves that this field strictly extends the classical Euclidean constructibles by demonstrating that degree-3 extensions are origami-achievable but not
compass-and-straightedge-achievable. Concrete results include the constructibility of the regular heptagon via the cubic 8c³ + 4c² − 4c − 1 = 0, the solvability of cube duplication through ∛2, and the
identification of the regular hendecagon as the first n-gon requiring multi-fold operations, since its minimal polynomial has degree 5 and φ(11) = 10 fails to be 2-3-smooth.
